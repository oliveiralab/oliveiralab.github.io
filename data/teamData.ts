    bio: `Dr. Mailson Freire de Oliveira is an Agronomist and a leader in digital agriculture. As a Water and Cropping Systems Assistant Extension Educator at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, he leads efforts that place farmers and stakeholders at the center of co-created, data-driven agricultural solutions. His extension approach blends cutting-edge technologies with practical problem-solving to enhance productivity, profitability, and sustainability. In 2024, he directly engaged 1,897 participants across 34 educational sessions. He co-leads signature programs like the Eastern Nebraska Corn & Soybean Expo and, as the Digital Agriculture Focus Team Leader, guides statewide programming and fosters cross-disciplinary collaborations.

His commitment to on-farm research is evident through trials conducted in collaboration with Nebraska's On-Farm Research Network, including evaluations of late-season cover crop seeding and center pivot application uniformity. Recognizing the evolving landscape of extension work, Dr. Oliveira actively seeks and implements technologies that increase efficiency. One example is his initiative to train extension professionals in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support content creation, decision support, and farmer engagement. This reflects his broader vision of integrating artificial intelligence into the extension toolbox to streamline communication, increase responsiveness, and better serve rural communities.

Dr. Oliveira's work also emphasizes growing the next generation of ag leaders, having introduced over 700 youth to digital agriculture through drone-based education. Formerly, he was a Postdoctoral Scientist in Agronomy (Data Science) with the Precision Agriculture Team at Auburn University (2021-2023), focusing on smart irrigation, soil sensor-based scheduling, and developing machine learning models.

He holds a Ph.D. in Agronomy (Crop Production) from São Paulo State University (2017-2021), where his dissertation focused on forecasting cultivation variables using remote sensing and machine learning. His Master's (2016-2017), also from São Paulo State University, involved predicting corn productivity using NDVI. He earned his Agronomic Engineering degree from the Federal Rural University of the Amazon (2011-2016).`,
