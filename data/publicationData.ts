    title: 'Generalization of peanut yield prediction models using artificial neural networks and vegetation indices',

    abstract: 'This study aimed to develop and generalize peanut yield prediction models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Field experiments were conducted in commercial peanut fields across Georgia, USA, over three consecutive crop seasons (2019, 2020, and 2021). Nine distinct VIs were calculated at different peanut growth stages. The ANNs were trained using data from individual years, combinations of years, and all years pooled together. The modelsâ€™ performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results demonstrated that the models developed using data from specific years or combinations of years achieved high accuracy in predicting peanut yield for those respective years, with R2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.90. However, when these models were applied to independent years, their performance significantly decreased. The generalized model, developed using data from all three years, showed robust performance across all years, with R2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.77. The most important VIs for peanut yield prediction were identified as EVI, SAVI, and OSAVI, particularly during the mid-season growth stages. These findings highlight the potential of using ANNs and Sentinel-2 VIs for accurate and generalized peanut yield prediction, which can assist farmers and stakeholders in making informed decisions for crop management and market planning.',
